============================================================
 Plant Species Classification based on Leaves Shape Features
============================================================

---------------------------------------------------------
Summary
---------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to apply reproducible research principles
to the problem of plant species classification from leaves shape features.

Our hypothesis is that is possible to train a classifier that is able to
achieve a better than random accuracy.
